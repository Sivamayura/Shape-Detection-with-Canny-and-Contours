# Shape-Detection-with-Canny-and-Contours
This project uses OpenCV to detect and analyze shapes in an image through Canny edge detection and contour extraction. The code processes grayscale images, identifies object boundaries, and visualizes filled contours to estimate shape areas and perform basic segmentation. Ideal for simple shape recognition and preprocessing tasks in image analysis.
